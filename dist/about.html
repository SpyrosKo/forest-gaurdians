                <p>
                    Green Planet Conservation was founded in 2010 by a group of passionate environmentalists who saw the need for a grassroots organization dedicated to protecting our planet. Since then, we have grown into a global movement with thousands of members and volunteers working tirelessly to preserve our environment and promote sustainable living.
